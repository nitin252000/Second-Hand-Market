# Second-Hand-Market
Second Hand Market is a platform for buying and selling services and goods such as electronics, fashion items, furniture, household goods, cars and bikes. It is a web portal that provides an easy way to sell and buy old products. If you have any product that you would like to sell, you can list them in the Sell Product section. Alternately, if you wish to buy, you can search the Buy Product section. SHM operates an online marketplace for consumer-to-consumer sales, particularly targeting users in emerging markets and it is not going to handle any payment processing, with a view to providing a safe, reliable and efficient way for consumers to buy and sell goods. We canâ€™t trust everyone that the owner of the product will deliver the product after getting money of it, so we simply tie up with courier service for collecting products, delivering products and collecting money from the buyer. After selecting the product for buying and its confirmation, courier person will take care of movement of products from seller to buyer.
